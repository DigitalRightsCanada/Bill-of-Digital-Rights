Plain-Language Summary of Bill C-0101

The Canadian Digital Freedom and Rights Act


---

What this bill is about

Bill C-0101 creates a Digital Bill of Rights for Canada. It says your personal data — your history, patterns, location, habits, and even your reputation online — belongs to you, not companies or government.

It makes sure you can control, delete, and even get paid when your data is used. It also forces transparency so no one can hide what they’re doing with your information.

Future-Proofing

Covers today’s technology and anything new that comes next.

Uses a “precautionary principle”: if there’s doubt about a system’s fairness or safety, it’s treated as risky until proven safe.

A Digital Futures Panel will advise Parliament on new tech risks.

A Schedule lists high-risk systems like facial recognition, predictive policing, credit scoring, child profiling, and brain-computer tech — with the ability to add more.
